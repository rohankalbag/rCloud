# rCloud - rohan's Cloud

rCloud is a secure file storage and sharing platform designed to provide users with a seamless and reliable way to store, share, and access their files from anywhere. It is currently a work under progress. It will be used to setup my homelab server as a cloud storage

It uses React Native for the frontend and Flask for the backend
